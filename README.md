> [!TIP]
> **A huge thank you to the community!** The support for Understand-Anything has been incredible. If this tool saves you a few minutes of digging through complexity, that's all I wanted. 🚀

**You just joined a new team. The codebase is 200,000 lines of code. Where do you even start?**

Understand Anything is a [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin that analyzes your project with a multi-agent pipeline, builds a knowledge graph of every file, function, class, and dependency, then gives you an interactive dashboard to explore it all visually. Stop reading code blind. Start seeing the big picture.

---

## 🤔 Why?

Reading code is hard. Understanding a whole codebase is harder. Documentation is always out of date, onboarding takes weeks, and every new feature feels like archaeology.

Understand Anything fixes this by combining **LLM intelligence** with **static analysis** to produce a living, explorable map of your project — with plain-English explanations for everything.

## 🎯 Who is this for?

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <h3>👩‍💻 Junior Developers</h3>
      <p>Stop drowning in unfamiliar code. Get guided tours that walk you through the architecture step by step, with every function and class explained in plain English.</p>
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <h3>📋 Product Managers & Designers</h3>
      <p>Finally understand how the system actually works without reading code. Ask questions like "how does authentication work?" and get clear answers grounded in the real codebase.</p>
    </td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
      <h3>🤖 AI-Assisted Developers</h3>
      <p>Give your AI tools deep context about your project. Use <code>/understand-diff</code> before code review, <code>/understand-explain</code> to dive into any module, or <code>/understand-chat</code> to reason about architecture.</p>

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install the plugin

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Lum1104/Understand-Anything
/plugin install understand-anything
```

### 2. Analyze your codebase

```bash
/understand
```

A multi-agent pipeline scans your project, extracts every file, function, class, and dependency, then builds a knowledge graph saved to `.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json`.

### 3. Explore the dashboard

```bash
/understand-dashboard
```

An interactive web dashboard opens with your codebase visualized as a graph — color-coded by architectural layer, searchable, and clickable. Select any node to see its code, relationships, and a plain-English explanation.

### 4. Keep learning

```bash
# Ask anything about the codebase
/understand-chat How does the payment flow work?

# Analyze impact of your current changes
/understand-diff

# Deep-dive into a specific file or function
/understand-explain src/auth/login.ts

# Generate an onboarding guide for new team members
/understand-onboard
```

## 🔧 Under the Hood

### Multi-Agent Pipeline

The `/understand` command orchestrates 5 specialized agents:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `project-scanner` | Discover files, detect languages and frameworks |
| `file-analyzer` | Extract functions, classes, imports; produce graph nodes and edges |
| `architecture-analyzer` | Identify architectural layers |
| `tour-builder` | Generate guided learning tours |
| `graph-reviewer` | Validate graph completeness and referential integrity (runs inline by default; use `--review` for full LLM review) |

File analyzers run in parallel (up to 5 concurrent, 20-30 files per batch). Supports incremental updates — only re-analyzes files that changed since the last run.

### Project Structure

```
understand-anything-plugin/
  .claude-plugin/  — Plugin manifest
  agents/          — Specialized AI agents
  skills/          — Skill definitions (/understand, /understand-chat, etc.)
  src/             — TypeScript source (context-builder, diff-analyzer, etc.)
  packages/
    core/          — Analysis engine (types, persistence, tree-sitter, search, schema, tours)
    dashboard/     — React + TypeScript web dashboard
```

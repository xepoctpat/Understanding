description: Analyze a codebase to produce an interactive knowledge graph for understanding architecture, components, and relationships
argument-hint: [options]
---

# /understand

Analyze the current codebase and produce a `knowledge-graph.json` file in `.understand-anything/`. This file powers the interactive dashboard for exploring the project's architecture.

## Options

- `$ARGUMENTS` may contain:
  - `--full` — Force a full rebuild, ignoring any existing graph
  - `--auto-update` — Enable automatic graph updates on commit (writes `autoUpdate: true` to `.understand-anything/config.json`)
  - `--no-auto-update` — Disable automatic graph updates (writes `autoUpdate: false` to `.understand-anything/config.json`)
  - `--review` — Run full LLM graph-reviewer instead of inline deterministic validation
  - A directory path — Scope analysis to a specific subdirectory

---

## Phase 0 — Pre-flight

Determine whether to run a full analysis or incremental update.

1. Set `PROJECT_ROOT` to the current working directory.
2. Get the current git commit hash:
   ```bash
   git rev-parse HEAD
   ```
3. Create the intermediate and temp output directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p $PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate
   mkdir -p $PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/tmp
   ```
3.5. **Auto-update configuration:**
   - If `--auto-update` is in `$ARGUMENTS`: write `{"autoUpdate": true}` to `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/config.json`
   - If `--no-auto-update` is in `$ARGUMENTS`: write `{"autoUpdate": false}` to `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/config.json`
   - These flags only set the config — analysis proceeds normally regardless.

4. Check if `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json` exists. If it does, read it.
5. Check if `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/meta.json` exists. If it does, read it to get `gitCommitHash`.
6. **Decision logic:**

   | Condition | Action |
   |---|---|
   | `--full` flag in `$ARGUMENTS` | Full analysis (all phases) |
   | No existing graph or meta | Full analysis (all phases) |
   | `--review` flag + existing graph + unchanged commit hash | Skip to Phase 6 (review-only — reuse existing assembled graph) |
   | Existing graph + unchanged commit hash | Ask the user: "The graph is up to date at this commit. Would you like to: **(a)** run a full rebuild (`--full`), **(b)** run the LLM graph reviewer (`--review`), or **(c)** do nothing?" Then follow their choice. If they pick (c), STOP. |
   | Existing graph + changed files | Incremental update (re-analyze changed files only) |

   **Review-only path:** Copy the existing `knowledge-graph.json` to `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate/assembled-graph.json`, then jump directly to Phase 6 step 3.

   For incremental updates, get the changed file list:
   ```bash
   git diff <lastCommitHash>..HEAD --name-only
   ```
   If this returns no files, report "Graph is up to date" and STOP.

7. **Collect project context for subagent injection:**
   - Read `README.md` (or `README.rst`, `readme.md`) from `$PROJECT_ROOT` if it exists. Store as `$README_CONTENT` (first 3000 characters).
   - Read the primary package manifest (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`) if it exists. Store as `$MANIFEST_CONTENT`.
   - Capture the top-level directory tree:
     ```bash
     find $PROJECT_ROOT -maxdepth 2 -type f -not -path '*/node_modules/*' -not -path '*/.git/*' -not -path '*/dist/*' | head -100
     ```
     Store as `$DIR_TREE`.
   - Detect the project entry point by checking for common patterns (in order): `src/index.ts`, `src/main.ts`, `src/App.tsx`, `index.js`, `main.py`, `manage.py`, `app.py`, `wsgi.py`, `asgi.py`, `run.py`, `__main__.py`, `main.go`, `cmd/*/main.go`, `src/main.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, `src/main/java/**/Application.java`, `Program.cs`, `config.ru`, `index.php`. Store first match as `$ENTRY_POINT`.

---

## Phase 1 — SCAN (Full analysis only)

Dispatch a subagent using the prompt template at `./project-scanner-prompt.md`. Read the template file and pass the full content as the subagent's prompt, appending the following additional context:

> **Additional context from main session:**
>
> Project README (first 3000 chars):
> ```
> $README_CONTENT
> ```
>
> Package manifest:
> ```
> $MANIFEST_CONTENT
> ```
>
> Use this context to produce more accurate project name, description, and framework detection. The README and manifest are authoritative — prefer their information over heuristics.

Pass these parameters in the dispatch prompt:

> Scan this project directory to discover all source files, detect languages and frameworks.
> Project root: `$PROJECT_ROOT`
> Write output to: `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate/scan-result.json`

After the subagent completes, read `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate/scan-result.json` to get:
- Project name, description
- Languages, frameworks
- File list with line counts
- Complexity estimate
- Import map (`importMap`): pre-resolved project-internal imports per file

Store `importMap` in memory as `$IMPORT_MAP` for use in Phase 2 batch construction.

**Gate check:** If >200 files, inform the user and suggest scoping with a subdirectory argument. Proceed only if user confirms or add guidance that this may take a while.

---

## Phase 2 — ANALYZE

### Full analysis path

Batch the file list from Phase 1 into groups of **20-30 files each** (aim for ~25 files per batch for balanced sizes).

For each batch, dispatch a subagent using the prompt template at `./file-analyzer-prompt.md`. Run up to **5 subagents concurrently** using parallel dispatch. Pass the template as the subagent's prompt, appending the following additional context:

> **Additional context from main session:**
>
> Project: `<projectName>` — `<projectDescription>`
> Languages: `<languages from Phase 1>`

Before dispatching each batch, construct `batchImportData` from `$IMPORT_MAP`:
```json
batchImportData = {}
for each file in this batch:
  batchImportData[file.path] = $IMPORT_MAP[file.path] ?? []
```

Fill in batch-specific parameters below and dispatch:

> Analyze these source files and produce GraphNode and GraphEdge objects.
> Project root: `$PROJECT_ROOT`
> Project: `<projectName>`
> Languages: `<languages>`
> Batch index: `<batchIndex>`
> Write output to: `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate/batch-<batchIndex>.json`
>
> Pre-resolved import data for this batch (use this for all import edge creation — do NOT re-resolve imports from source):
> ```json
> <batchImportData JSON>
> ```
>
> Files to analyze in this batch:
> 1. `<path>` (<sizeLines> lines)
> 2. `<path>` (<sizeLines> lines)
> ...

After ALL batches complete, read each `batch-<N>.json` file and merge:
- Combine all `nodes` arrays. If duplicate node IDs exist, keep the later occurrence.
- Combine all `edges` arrays. Deduplicate by the composite key `source + target + type`.

### Incremental update path

Use the changed files list from Phase 0. Batch and dispatch file-analyzer subagents using the same process as above (20-30 files per batch, up to 5 concurrent, with batchImportData constructed from $IMPORT_MAP), but only for changed files.

After batches complete, merge with the existing graph:
1. Remove old nodes whose `filePath` matches any changed file
2. Remove old edges whose `source` or `target` references a removed node
3. Add new nodes and edges from the fresh analysis

---

## Phase 3 — ASSEMBLE

Merge all file-analyzer results into a single set of nodes and edges. Then perform basic integrity cleanup:

- Remove any edge whose `source` or `target` references a node ID that does not exist in the merged node set
- Remove duplicate node IDs (keep the last occurrence)
- Log any removed edges or nodes for the final summary

---

## Phase 4 — ARCHITECTURE

**Build the combined prompt template:**
1. Read the base template at `./architecture-analyzer-prompt.md`.
2. **Language context injection:** For each language detected in Phase 1 (e.g., `python`), read the file at `./languages/<language-id>.md` (e.g., `./languages/python.md`) and append its content after the base template under a `## Language Context` header. If the file does not exist for a detected language, skip it silently and continue. These files are in the `languages/` subdirectory next to this SKILL.md file.
3. **Framework addendum injection:** For each framework detected in Phase 1 (e.g., `Django`), read the file at `./frameworks/<framework-id-lowercase>.md` (e.g., `./frameworks/django.md`) and append its full content after the language context. If the file does not exist for a detected framework, skip it silently and continue. These files are in the `frameworks/` subdirectory next to this SKILL.md file.

Pass the combined content as the subagent's prompt, appending the following additional context:

> **Additional context from main session:**
>
> Frameworks detected: `<frameworks from Phase 1>`
>
> Directory tree (top 2 levels):
> ```
> $DIR_TREE
> ```
>
> Use the directory tree, language context, and framework addendums (appended above) to inform layer assignments. Directory structure is strong evidence for layer boundaries.

Pass these parameters in the dispatch prompt:

> Analyze this codebase's structure to identify architectural layers.
> Project root: `$PROJECT_ROOT`
> Write output to: `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate/layers.json`
> Project: `<projectName>` — `<projectDescription>`
>
> File nodes:
> ```json
> [list of {id, name, filePath, summary, tags} for all file-type nodes — omit complexity, languageNotes]
> ```
>
> Import edges:
> ```json
> [list of edges with type "imports"]
> ```

After the subagent completes, read `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate/layers.json` and normalize it into a final `layers` array. Apply these steps **in order**:

1. **Unwrap envelope:** If the file contains `{ "layers": [...] }` instead of a plain array, extract the inner array. (The prompt requests a plain array, but LLMs may still produce an envelope.)
2. **Rename legacy fields:** If any layer object has a `nodes` field instead of `nodeIds`, rename `nodes` → `nodeIds`. If `nodes` entries are objects with an `id` field rather than plain strings, extract just the `id` values into `nodeIds`.
3. **Synthesize missing IDs:** If any layer is missing an `id`, generate one as `layer:<kebab-case-name>`.
4. **Convert file paths:** If `nodeIds` entries are raw file paths (not prefixed with `file:`), convert them to `file:<relative-path>`.
5. **Drop dangling refs:** Remove any `nodeIds` entries that do not exist in the merged node set.

Each element of the final `layers` array MUST have this shape:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "layer:<kebab-case-name>",
    "name": "<layer name>",
    "description": "<what belongs in this layer>",
    "nodeIds": ["file:src/App.tsx", "file:src/main.tsx"]
  }
]
```

All four fields (`id`, `name`, `description`, `nodeIds`) are required.

**For incremental updates:** Always re-run architecture analysis on the full merged node set, since layer assignments may shift when files change.

**Context for incremental updates:** When re-running architecture analysis, also inject the previous layer definitions:

> Previous layer definitions (for naming consistency):
> ```json
> [previous layers from existing graph]
> ```
>
> Maintain the same layer names and IDs where possible. Only add/remove layers if the file structure has materially changed.

---

## Phase 5 — TOUR

Dispatch a subagent using the prompt template at `./tour-builder-prompt.md`. Read the template file and pass the full content as the subagent's prompt, appending the following additional context:

> **Additional context from main session:**
>
> Project README (first 3000 chars):
> ```
> $README_CONTENT
> ```
>
> Project entry point: `$ENTRY_POINT`
>
> Use the README to align the tour narrative with the project's own documentation. Start the tour from the entry point if one was detected. The tour should tell the same story the README tells, but through the lens of actual code structure.

Pass these parameters in the dispatch prompt:

> Create a guided learning tour for this codebase.
> Project root: `$PROJECT_ROOT`
> Write output to: `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate/tour.json`
> Project: `<projectName>` — `<projectDescription>`
> Languages: `<languages>`
>
> Nodes (file nodes only):
> ```json
> [list of {id, name, filePath, summary, type} for file-type nodes ONLY — do NOT include function or class nodes]
> ```
>
> Layers:
> ```json
> [list of {id, name, description} for each layer — omit nodeIds]
> ```
>
> Edges (imports and calls only):
> ```json
> [list of edges where type is "imports" or "calls" only — exclude all other edge types]
> ```

After the subagent completes, read `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate/tour.json` and normalize it into a final `tour` array. Apply these steps **in order**:

1. **Unwrap envelope:** If the file contains `{ "steps": [...] }` instead of a plain array, extract the inner array. (The prompt requests a plain array, but LLMs may still produce an envelope.)
2. **Rename legacy fields:** If any step has `nodesToInspect` instead of `nodeIds`, rename it → `nodeIds`. If any step has `whyItMatters` instead of `description`, rename it → `description`.
3. **Convert file paths:** If `nodeIds` entries are raw file paths, convert them to `file:<relative-path>`.
4. **Drop dangling refs:** Remove any `nodeIds` entries that do not exist in the merged node set.
5. **Sort** by `order` before saving.

Each element of the final `tour` array MUST have this shape:

```json
[
  {
    "order": 1,
    "title": "Start at the app entry",
    "description": "This step explains how the frontend boots and mounts.",
    "nodeIds": ["file:src/main.tsx", "file:src/App.tsx"]
  }
]
```

Required fields: `order`, `title`, `description`, `nodeIds`. Preserve optional `languageLesson` when present.

---

## Phase 6 — REVIEW

Assemble the full KnowledgeGraph JSON object:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "project": {
    "name": "<projectName>",
    "languages": ["<languages>"],
    "frameworks": ["<frameworks>"],
    "description": "<projectDescription>",
    "analyzedAt": "<ISO 8601 timestamp>",
    "gitCommitHash": "<commit hash from Phase 0>"
  },
  "nodes": [<all merged nodes from Phase 3>],
  "edges": [<all merged edges from Phase 3>],
  "layers": [<layers from Phase 4>],
  "tour": [<steps from Phase 5>]
}
```

1. Before writing the assembled graph, validate that:
   - `layers` is an array of objects with these required fields: `id`, `name`, `description`, `nodeIds`
   - `tour` is an array of objects with these required fields: `order`, `title`, `description`, `nodeIds`
   - `tour[*].languageLesson` is allowed as an optional string field
   - Every `layers[*].nodeIds` entry exists in the merged node set
   - Every `tour[*].nodeIds` entry exists in the merged node set

   If validation fails, automatically normalize and rewrite the graph into this shape before saving. If the graph still fails final validation after the normalization pass, save it with warnings but mark dashboard auto-launch as skipped.

2. Write the assembled graph to `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate/assembled-graph.json`.

3. **Check `$ARGUMENTS` for `--review` flag.** Then run the appropriate validation path:

---

#### Default path (no `--review`): inline deterministic validation

Write the following Node.js script to `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/tmp/ua-inline-validate.cjs`:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
const fs = require('fs');
const graphPath = process.argv[2];
const outputPath = process.argv[3];
try {
  const graph = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(graphPath, 'utf8'));
  const issues = [], warnings = [];
  if (!Array.isArray(graph.nodes)) { issues.push('graph.nodes is missing or not an array'); graph.nodes = []; }
  if (!Array.isArray(graph.edges)) { issues.push('graph.edges is missing or not an array'); graph.edges = []; }
  const nodeIds = new Set();
  const seen = new Map();
  graph.nodes.forEach((n, i) => {
    if (!n.id) { issues.push(`Node[${i}] missing id`); return; }
    if (!n.type) issues.push(`Node[${i}] '${n.id}' missing type`);
    if (!n.name) issues.push(`Node[${i}] '${n.id}' missing name`);
    if (!n.summary) issues.push(`Node[${i}] '${n.id}' missing summary`);
    if (!n.tags || !n.tags.length) issues.push(`Node[${i}] '${n.id}' missing tags`);
    if (seen.has(n.id)) issues.push(`Duplicate node ID '${n.id}' at indices ${seen.get(n.id)} and ${i}`);
    else seen.set(n.id, i);
    nodeIds.add(n.id);
  });
  graph.edges.forEach((e, i) => {
    if (!nodeIds.has(e.source)) issues.push(`Edge[${i}] source '${e.source}' not found`);
    if (!nodeIds.has(e.target)) issues.push(`Edge[${i}] target '${e.target}' not found`);
  });
  const fileNodes = graph.nodes.filter(n => n.type === 'file').map(n => n.id);
  const assigned = new Map();
  if (!Array.isArray(graph.layers)) { if (graph.layers) warnings.push('graph.layers is not an array'); graph.layers = []; }
  if (!Array.isArray(graph.tour)) { if (graph.tour) warnings.push('graph.tour is not an array'); graph.tour = []; }
  graph.layers.forEach(layer => {
    (layer.nodeIds || []).forEach(id => {
      if (!nodeIds.has(id)) issues.push(`Layer '${layer.id}' refs missing node '${id}'`);
      if (assigned.has(id)) issues.push(`Node '${id}' appears in multiple layers`);
      assigned.set(id, layer.id);
    });
  });
  fileNodes.forEach(id => {
    if (!assigned.has(id)) issues.push(`File node '${id}' not in any layer`);
  });
  graph.tour.forEach((step, i) => {
    (step.nodeIds || []).forEach(id => {
      if (!nodeIds.has(id)) issues.push(`Tour step[${i}] refs missing node '${id}'`);
    });
  });
  const withEdges = new Set([
    ...graph.edges.map(e => e.source),
    ...graph.edges.map(e => e.target)
  ]);
  graph.nodes.forEach(n => {
    if (!withEdges.has(n.id)) warnings.push(`Node '${n.id}' has no edges (orphan)`);
  });
  const stats = {
    totalNodes: graph.nodes.length,
    totalEdges: graph.edges.length,
    totalLayers: graph.layers.length,
    tourSteps: graph.tour.length,
    nodeTypes: graph.nodes.reduce((a, n) => { a[n.type] = (a[n.type]||0)+1; return a; }, {}),
    edgeTypes: graph.edges.reduce((a, e) => { a[e.type] = (a[e.type]||0)+1; return a; }, {})
  };
  fs.writeFileSync(outputPath, JSON.stringify({ issues, warnings, stats }, null, 2));
  process.exit(0);
} catch (err) { process.stderr.write(err.message + '\n'); process.exit(1); }
```

Execute it:
```bash
node $PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/tmp/ua-inline-validate.cjs \
  "$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate/assembled-graph.json" \
  "$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate/review.json"
```

If the script exits non-zero, read stderr, fix the script, and retry once.

---

#### `--review` path: full LLM reviewer

If `--review` IS in `$ARGUMENTS`, dispatch the LLM graph-reviewer subagent as follows:

Dispatch a subagent using the prompt template at `./graph-reviewer-prompt.md`. Read the template file and pass the full content as the subagent's prompt, appending the following additional context:

> **Additional context from main session:**
>
> Phase 1 scan results (file inventory):
> ```json
> [list of {path, sizeLines} from scan-result.json]
> ```
>
> Phase warnings/errors accumulated during analysis:
> - [list any batch failures, skipped files, or warnings from Phases 2-5]
>
> Cross-validate: every file in the scan inventory should have a corresponding `file:` node in the graph. Flag any missing files. Also flag any graph nodes whose `filePath` doesn't appear in the scan inventory.

Pass these parameters in the dispatch prompt:

> Validate the knowledge graph at `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate/assembled-graph.json`.
> Project root: `$PROJECT_ROOT`
> Read the file and validate it for completeness and correctness.
> Write output to: `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate/review.json`

---

4. Read `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate/review.json`.

5. **If `issues` array is non-empty:**
   - Review the `issues` list
   - Apply automated fixes where possible:
     - Remove edges with dangling references
     - Fill missing required fields with sensible defaults (e.g., empty `tags` -> `["untagged"]`, empty `summary` -> `"No summary available"`)
     - Remove nodes with invalid types
   - Re-run the final graph validation after automated fixes
   - If critical issues remain after one fix attempt, save the graph anyway but include the warnings in the final report and mark dashboard auto-launch as skipped

6. **If `issues` array is empty:** Proceed to Phase 7.

---

## Phase 7 — SAVE

1. Write the final knowledge graph to `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json`.

2. Write metadata to `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/meta.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "lastAnalyzedAt": "<ISO 8601 timestamp>",
     "gitCommitHash": "<commit hash>",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "analyzedFiles": <number of files analyzed>
   }
   ```

2.5. **Generate structural fingerprints** for all analyzed files and save to `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/fingerprints.json`. This creates the baseline for future automatic incremental updates.

   Write and execute a Node.js script that:
   1. Reads each source file path from the scan results (Phase 1)
   2. For each file: computes a SHA-256 content hash, then extracts function/class/import/export declarations via regex matching:
      - Functions: `function NAME(`, `const NAME = (`, `export function NAME(`, arrow functions assigned to const/let
      - Classes: `class NAME`, `export class NAME`
      - Imports: `import ... from '...'`, `import '...'`
      - Exports: `export { ... }`, `export default`, `export function`, `export class`, `export const`
   3. For each function: record name, parameter names, whether exported, and line count
   4. For each class: record name, method names, property names, whether exported
   5. Writes the fingerprint store JSON to `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/fingerprints.json`:
      ```json
      {
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "gitCommitHash": "<commit hash>",
        "generatedAt": "<ISO timestamp>",
        "files": {
          "<filePath>": {
            "filePath": "<filePath>",
            "contentHash": "<sha256>",
            "functions": [{ "name": "...", "params": ["..."], "exported": true, "lineCount": 35 }],
            "classes": [{ "name": "...", "methods": ["..."], "properties": ["..."], "exported": true, "lineCount": 50 }],
            "imports": [{ "source": "...", "specifiers": ["..."] }],
            "exports": ["name1", "name2"],
            "totalLines": 120
          }
        }
      }
      ```

3. Clean up intermediate files:
   ```bash
   rm -rf $PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/intermediate
   rm -rf $PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/tmp
   ```

4. Report a summary to the user containing:
   - Project name and description
   - Files analyzed / total files
   - Nodes created (broken down by type: file, function, class)
   - Edges created (broken down by type)
   - Layers identified (with names)
   - Tour steps generated (count)
   - Any warnings from the reviewer
   - Path to the output file: `$PROJECT_ROOT/.understand-anything/knowledge-graph.json`

5. Only automatically launch the dashboard by invoking the `/understand-dashboard` skill if final graph validation passed after normalization/review fixes.
   If final validation did not pass, report that the graph was saved with warnings and dashboard launch was skipped.

---

## Error Handling

- If any subagent dispatch fails, retry **once** with the same prompt plus additional context about the failure.
- Track all warnings and errors from each phase in a `$PHASE_WARNINGS` list. When using `--review`, pass this list to the graph-reviewer in Phase 6. On the default path, include accumulated warnings in the Phase 7 final report.
- If it fails a second time, skip that phase and continue with partial results.
- ALWAYS save partial results — a partial graph is better than no graph.
- Report any skipped phases or errors in the final summary so the user knows what happened.
- NEVER silently drop errors. Every failure must be visible in the final report.
